# Tache - Simple CLI task manager

Tache is simply a task queue that can be managed through the CLI.

# TODO

- Want to be able to see priority on 'tache list'.

## Installation

1. run `dune build`
2. copy the 'main.exe' file from `_build/default/bin/main.exe` to a location on your `$PATH` and rename it to `tache`
3. set the `tache` file to be executable `chmod +x tache`
